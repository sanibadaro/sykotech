 look at the set of numbers.
 for each number, see if it’s bigger than any earlier number.
 if it is, remember that number.
 keep going until you’ve looked at them all.
 the last number you remembered is the largest.

Here’s a better algorithm (I thought of it around step 3., above):
. sort the numbers in decreasing order.
. the one at the top is the biggest.
